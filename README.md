Friend Finder is a social application that utilizes the express npm package to store user information and match them with a friend who most closely matches interests.

To get started run an npm install, then click the "Go to Survey" button and fill out the questions.  When you click "Submit" you will be connected with your best match!

One improvement I plan on making is to add a more efficient validation for the name and photo links on the survey page
